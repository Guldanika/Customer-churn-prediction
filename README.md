# Predicting Customer Churn: Identifying Customers Susceptible to Churn

## Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecommunications industry, where companies face intense competition, changing customer preferences, and pricing pressures. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churning, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Business Problem
Reder Telecom is experiencing an increasing churn rate, which negatively impacts revenue and profitability. The company faces the following challenges:
- **Intense competition** from numerous market players.
- **Evolving customer preferences** demanding personalized, high-quality services.
- **Pricing pressures** that affect profitability and sustainability.
- **Network quality issues** leading to dissatisfaction and churn.
- **Challenges in maintaining customer loyalty.**

## Project Rationale
Churn prediction enables businesses to identify customers likely to leave, allowing them to implement targeted retention strategies. The benefits of this project include:
- **Cost Reduction:** Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
- **Revenue Growth:** Reducing churn leads to higher customer lifetime value and revenue.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Understanding churn factors helps improve service quality.
- **Competitive Advantage:** Leveraging data analytics allows for proactive decision-making.
- **Data-Driven Strategies:** Enhancing business strategies using customer insights.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a **predictive model** to identify at-risk customers.
- Analyze key **factors influencing churn** using data analytics.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of historical customer information, including:
- **Customer Demographics**: ID, Name, Age, Gender, Location.
- **Contact Information**: Email, Phone, Address.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Segment category (e.g., A, B, C).
- **Purchase History**: Products bought, purchase frequency, and value.
- **Subscription Details**: Plan type, start date, end date.
- **Website & App Usage**: Page views, time spent.
- **Clickstream Data**: User actions such as clicks, searches, and cart additions.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Logins, engagement frequency (Daily/Weekly/Monthly).
- **Customer Feedback**: Ratings (1-5) and comments.
- **Marketing Communication**: Email engagement (sent, opened, clicked).
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Loyalty and satisfaction rating.
- **Churn Label**: Binary indicator (1 - churned, 0 - retained).
- **Timestamp**: Data recording time.

## Tech Stack
This project is implemented in **Python** using the following libraries:
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning modeling and evaluation.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather and integrate customer data from multiple sources.
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyze dataset structure, perform statistical analysis, and derive insights.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale variables, and encode categorical features.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features, segment data, and remove irrelevant attributes.
5. **Model Development**: Train machine learning models for churn prediction.
6. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Expected Outcomes
- A **machine learning model** that accurately predicts customer churn.
- Insights into the most **influential factors** driving customer churn.
- Business recommendations to **improve retention strategies** and reduce churn rates.

## Next Steps
- Experiment with **different ML models** and hyperparameter tuning.
- Incorporate **additional customer behavioral data** for better predictions.
- Deploy the model into a **real-time monitoring system** for proactive retention efforts.
